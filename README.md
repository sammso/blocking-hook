# Liferay 6.2 - Blocking Hook

This has been created for issue https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-91976 and https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-91975

This is example how to basically block content so that it won't accidentally hit to Liferay's `com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.aggregate.AggregateFilter`.

## Build

mvn package
```
